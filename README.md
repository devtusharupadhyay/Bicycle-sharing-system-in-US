# Bike-Sharing-System-In-US
Bike share in the U.S. has continued its brisk growth, with 35 million trips taken in 2017, 25% more than in 2016. This growth is attributable to increasing ridership in existing systems as well as the launch of several major new bike share systems across the country. Since 2010, 123 million trips have been taken on bike share bikes in the U.S. 2017 also saw the advent of a new bike share customer interface, commonly known as dockless bike share. Rollout has been uneven: after a series of unpermitted systems launched (and subsequently closed) in various cities across the U.S., numerous cities responded with pilot programs to permit dockless bike share operations. By the end of 2017, five major dockless bike share companies reported operating in approximately 25 cities and suburbs. More Systems, More Cities, More Bikes, More Companies
